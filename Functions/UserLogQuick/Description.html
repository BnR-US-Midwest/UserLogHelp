  <h1>Description</h1>

  <p>This is the most user-friendly function of the UserLog libray with only three inputs and a single call to execute.  The STRING <code>message</code> is written directly to the User logbook (a logbook automatically created by Automation Runtime.  The message can be categorized with <code>severity</code> and <code>code</code> inputs.</p>

  <p>Depending on the UserLog's current severity level, set by UserLogSetSeverityLevel, this function's message can be suppressed.  If suppressed, nothing is written to the logbook and the function returns zero.</p>

  <p>The size (or length) of the string passed to <code>message</code> is unrestricted because it is passed by reference.  This is denoted by STRING[0].  Messages in the UserLog library are truncated by <code>USERLOG_MESSAGE_LENGTH</code>.</p>

  <p>The Event ID created for the record entry in the User logbook uses parameters <code>severity</code> and <code>code</code>, then the facility <code>USERLOG_FACILITY</code>.  To use a custom facility, see UserLogMessage.</p>

  <p>If an error occurs during execution, an automatic message will be written to the User logbook with a description of the error.  The function will return zero.</p>
