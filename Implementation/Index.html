  <h1>Implementation</h1>
  <p>The UserLog library source code is written in C.  The implementation utilizes the existing ArEventLog library's function blocks to create, reference, and write to user logbooks.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to write to any Automation Runtime system logbook with either UserLog or ArEventLog libraries.  Automation Runtime creates one logbook named "User", referenced with <code>"$arlogusr"</code>, and can be written to automatically with UserLogQuick.</p>
  <p>Users can create logbooks in an <code>_INIT</code> routine using the UserLogCreate function and subsequently writing to those logbooks with UserLogMessage.</p>
