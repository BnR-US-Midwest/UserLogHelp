  <h2>Text System</h2>

  <p>Messages written with the UserLog library are compatible with the Automation Studio text system.  User event localized text files can be created with namespace <code>User/EventLog</code>.  The Text ID should match the event ID create with the message written by UserLog.  See ArEventLogMakeEventID for more information.</p>

  <p>A text system configuration is required to deploy text files to your configuration.</p>
