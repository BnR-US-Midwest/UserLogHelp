  <h2>Text System</h2>

  <p>Messages written with the UserLog library are compatible with the Automation Studio text system.  User Event Text files can be created with namespace <code>User/EventLog</code>.  The Text ID should match the Event ID created of the message written with UserLog.  See ArEventLogMakeEventID for more information.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p><a href="../Functions/UserLogBasic/Index.html">UserLogBasic</a> not only writes a message from code, but can link an additional description through the text system.  The following example is a line a Structured Text code.</p>

  <pre>
    UserLogBasic(USERLOG_SEVERITY_INFORMATION, 1234, 'Hello World!');
  </pre>

  <p>The Event ID for this example is 1611269330.  The severity is 1 (INFORMATION), the facility is 10 (USERLOG_FACILITY), and the code is 1234.  See ArEventLogMakeEventID for more information on how to derive the 32-bit Event ID.</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Bit(s)</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0..15</td>
      <td>Code 0..65535</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>16..27</td>
      <td>Facility 0..4095</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>28</td>
      <td>Reserved (0 for customized event IDs)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>29</td>
      <td>Customer (1 for customized event IDs)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>30..31</td>
        <td>Severity 0..3 (Success, Information, Warning, Error)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>A User Event Texts file can be created to assign text to Text IDs (Event IDs).  The setup requirements for User Event Text files can be followed <a href="Requirements.html">here</a>.</p>

  <img src="User Event Texts sample file.png" alt="User Event Texts sample file" style="width: 731px; height: 189px;">

  <p>The logger will show the following results.  Text from code is placed in the ASCII Data of the logbook record while text from the User Texts File is placed in the Description (Binary Data).</p>
